                "The platform is used by institutions such as school districts and universities to centralize student support. Users with different roles (mental health counselors, institution administrators, Care Solace staff, etc.) access tailored views to monitor caseloads, track outreach, and follow up on student statuses over time.",
                "Each institution has its own dedicated page where students, parents, and teachers can securely create new cases. These submissions are routed into the dashboard so counselors can review details, prioritize risk, and coordinate next steps, keeping all communication and history in one place.",
                "On the engineering side, I contributed across the full stack: building and maintaining Django REST API endpoints, integrating with a PostgreSQL database, implementing React and TypeScript components for the dashboards, and connecting workflows with Slack bot integrations to notify staff about new or updated cases.",
                "Some frontend changes and implementations came from UI/UX designers that gave me a Figma file and I had to translate it into a responsive web, this is an example: https://www.caresolace.com/site/test-city1"
